### Kiwi intro

Oh hi this is ~~kiwi~~ Yining!  
my GitHub is at [here](https://github.com/Yiningisakiwi)  
I have just started to play with R  
Rookie on the road!

### Kiwi talking to herself

Kiwi is **trying** to figure this out  
It seems not a good idea to try rmarkdown before you actually learn any
R

#### Lists and links

Anyway  
**Kiwi is the best fruit in the world!**  
And according to
[baidubaike](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%8C%95%E7%8C%B4%E6%A1%83/282710?fr=aladdin)  
It tastes like the combination of  
1. Strawberry  
2. Pineapple  
3. Banana  
(Wow. Whoever wrote this must be a *big* fan of kiwis.)

Also,  
- It’s juicy and nutritious  
- With things like:  
- Vitamin C  
- Calcium  
- Necessary amino acids  
*Hey, I indented 1 tab. Why is the list still like this?*

-   I just wanted a list
-   gimme one plz!

Okay, so for a list you need new paragraphs here, I guess?  
- And I will try

-   Yes, indeed

#### Images

So next I will be trying to get how to add a picture of kiwi here.
![kiwis](https://gimg2.baidu.com/image_search/src=http%3A%2F%2Fhbimg.b0.upaiyun.com%2F571208e861c12bcb1592c34068ec224643b72c9061123-nknhId_fw658&refer=http%3A%2F%2Fhbimg.b0.upaiyun.com&app=2002&size=f9999,10000&q=a80&n=0&g=0n&fmt=jpeg?sec=1633162916&t=86c28f816917b9ca2363a723d8484a32)  
God, it’s **Huge**, I’ll try again.  
<img src="kiwis.jfif" id="id" class="class" style="width:30.0%;height:30.0%" alt="kiwis" />  
now that’s much better!(remember not to give spaces between numbers and
the “=” mark)

#### Citations

This kiwi is also a **mangrove** lover Here I will try to cite an
article from my report! Lewis, perhaps? (Lewis 2005).  
Thank you, Lewis! Guess that’s it for today!
